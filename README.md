# R-library

This repo contains some R stats functions I expect to develop during the [Hackerank](https://www.hackerrank.com) stats challenges. Soon I will tell you more. It is noteworthy that each function output is adapted to the **stdout** (standard output), so they can be smoothly modify for other purposses.
